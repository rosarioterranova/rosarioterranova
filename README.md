### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software engineer with a love for web and 3D development.

I've developed software applications for a ton of different platforms with different technologies and tools.

I have worked with Javascript and C# mainly, with frameworks such as React.js, Next.js, Unity 3D, Unreal Engine, WebGL, and other related techs.

The reason that drives me to study and acquire new skills is my passion for programming and computer science, which I keep feed every day and I like to share with others.
